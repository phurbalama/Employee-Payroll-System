# Employee-Payroll-System
Using C++, I created Payroll class with private variable and added necessary constructor, mutator, accessors, input, & output functions in the header file and defined function in the source file. I built Dynamic array to store from a disk file called data.dat. create pointer object so that the program doesnt take heavy memory.
